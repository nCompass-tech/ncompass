# nCompass SDK Examples

Ready-to-run example scripts demonstrating how to use the nCompass SDK for profiling and tracing AI inference workloads on GPUs and other accelerators.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The best way to use nCompass is through our **[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nCompassTech.ncprof-vscode)**, which provides seamless integration between your codebase and performance traces.

📖 **New to nCompass?** Check out our [quick start guide](https://docs.ncompass.tech/ncprof/quick-start) to get up and running in minutes.

## 📚 Available Examples

Each example is self-contained and demonstrates different profiling workflows:

- **[Basic Example - TorchRecord Profiling](basic_example/)** — Get started with PyTorch profiling using automatic tracepoint injection
- **[Nsight Systems Example](nsys_example/)** — Profile GPU kernels with Nsight Systems integration and convert nsys traces to chrome traces to view in the VSCode IDE.
- **[Profiling remotely on Modal](profiling_session/)** — Run profiling sessions on remote compute infrastructure

> 💡 **Tip**: Each example includes a detailed README with step-by-step instructions and explanations.
